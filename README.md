study of safety and efficacy of the test drug in a four-arm crossover design

## Getting started

The trial is a study of safety and efficacy of the test drug in a four-arm crossover
design. The test compound is compared to a standard, reference treatment of ibuprofen, both at a 30mg daily dose. Two alternate doses are available: 15mg, twice per day; and 10mg, three times per day (coded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

At a recruitment visit to any one of the five sites enrolling patients for the study, demographic information is collected along with informed consent. Those patients continuing on the study are referred for a first clinical visit. The first clinical visit establishes baseline vital signs, lab results, and pain measurements, and provides a final check of screening criteria. Exclusion criteria include: age, under 21 or over 70; pregnant females; high blood pressure at outset or during treatment phase (systolic > 140 or diastolic > 90); unwillingness to sign informed consent; and baseline pain level below threshold (0 on the pain scale).

Patients continuing are randomized to one of four study arms: TRTR, RTRT, RTTR, and TRRT (T-Test, R-Reference). Subsequent visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months include vital signs, lab results, and pain measurements. Except for the final visit, each visit also serves to check inclusion criteria are still satisfied and serves as the transition point among treatment elements in the assigned arms (for subjects continuing on the study).
